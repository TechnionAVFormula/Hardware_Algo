## Tractive System
The Tractive System contains every part that is electrically connected to the motor(s) and TS
accumulators (EV1.1.1).

### Properties
- Output Power Limitation - 80kW (EV2.2.1).
- Maximum Voltage (between any two electrical connections) - 600VDC (EV4.1.1).
- Overcurrent protection:
    - All overcurrent protection devices in the TS must not rely on programmable logic except of an unmodiﬁed commercially available motor controllers/inverters (EV3.2.5).
    - The TS high current path through the accumulator(s) must be fused (EV3.2.7).

### General
- All components in the TS must be rated for the maximum TS voltage (EV4.1.2).
- The TS area of a PCB, see EV4.3.5, is considered as one component. Every input connected to the TS must be rated to the maximum TS voltage (EV4.1.2).
- All components must be rated for the maximum possible temperature which may occur
during usage (EV4.1.3).
- All connections from a TS component to external devices, such as laptops must include galvanic isolation (EV4.3.7).

### Labeling
- Every housing or enclosure containing parts of the TS system, must be labeled with (a)
reasonably sized sticker(s) according to “ISO 7010-W012” (triangle with black lightning
bolt on yellow background). The sticker must also contain the text “High Voltage” if the
voltage is more than 60 VDC or 25 VAC (EV4.2.1).


### Inspection
IN4.1.1 The insulation resistance between the TS and LVS ground will be measured. Vehicles with
a maximum TS voltage less than or equal to 250 V will be probed with 250 V and vehicles
with a maximum TS voltage greater than 250 V with 500 V.
